  family moved to Washington Co., Ky., in 1818 to Brown county, Ohio,

  Historical Biog:
  William Robinson came to Gillam township, Jasper county in
  1838, and was thus one of the earliest settlers. He was a tall
  man, of imposing appearance. During the War of the Rebellion,
  his sons Michael, William and Thomas were in the Battle of Gettysburg,
  at which time William was shot in the face by a sniper. He,
  on hearing the news, donned his tall hat and long coat and took a
  train to the hospital where his son lay wounded. On being told
  it would be out of the question to move the son to a hospital
  where he could be better cared for, he went into action, and had
  him on a train that eveing. It is said he twirled his Masonic
  charm which he wore on his watch chain, which must have helped.
  On another occasion, word came that his son Thomas was in an
  army prison, after being involved with a buddy in an altercation
  with an officer, and Thomas came to his aid. The father immediately
  entrained for Washington, D.C. where he went directly to
  his Congressman, Schuyler C. Colfax. Mr. Colfax took him to see
  the President, Abraham  Lincoln. Mr. Lincoln asked: "What do you
  wish from me, Mr. Robinson?" The reply: "Mr. President, I have
  three sons in the Union Army. I sent them to fight, not to rot
  in prison." It is related that Pres. Lincoln reached for a pen
  and wrote out an order, directing the military to restore Thomas
  to active duty with his regiment.
  It is evident that Mr. William Harrison Robinson was a man
  of strong character!

  a farmer, and was county commissioner at the time the county
  court house was built in Rensselaer. He served all through the
  Civil War, being promoted from Private to Lieutenant. In his
  pension papers we find a story of a terrible experience that
  illustrates the suffering the soldiers endured from sickness
  and hardships. On New Year 1864 he was in charge of a group of
  men en route to their homes on furlough. They were thoroughly
  soaked in rain, then placed in a cattle car of a train, with
  no protection. The temperature dropped to a very low degree
  so their clothing froze to their bodies, their boots to their
  feet. On the slow journey north, it was January 8th. before
  he arrived at his home, and by this time he was very ill, and
  was unable to return to duty for some time. He suffered after
  effects the rest of his live. (History of C.L.Guild Post,

  man (Daniel Swisher) died within a few days. He was brought to trial on

Ind., where he was twice elected county sheriff. In Feb. 1861
he moved his family to Pulaski county, Ind and settled one mile south
of Medaryville. Here Elmer C. Williams was born on Feb, 1, 1862, other
children were: Dayton H., Horace E., and Minnie Williams. Richard died
Sep. 7, 1880.
