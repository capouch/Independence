  Robb; thus: son Thomas married a 2d. cousin, Elizabeth Robb. and in
  1800 with their son, William, moved to Erie county, Penn. In 1808 the
  family moved to Washington Co., Ky., in 1818 to Brown county, Ohio,
  near Ripley. They came to Warren county, Indiana in 1830. Ever a roamer,
  Thomas died in DeKalb county, Illinois in 1850. His first wdfe had died
  in Ohio, he married 2d. to Mrs. Sarah Friel, who survived him for a short
  time. Thomas and Elizabeth had children: twins James and John, William,
  Thomas, Robert, Mary, Ann and Elizabeth. James served in the regular army
  for five years and in the War of 1812 under General Andrew Jackson, and
  later took part in the Seminole war. JOHN was in the War of 1812,
  fighting under General William H. Harrison. See page 8-11, "Biographical
