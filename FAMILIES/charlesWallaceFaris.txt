   Regarding Charles Wallace Faris:
He was born Aug 19, 1858 although his gravestone says 1859??   He had 2 sons, Ira and Guy with his first wife; after her death he married my grandmother Jennie Logan Faris.  Interesting to me that after marriage (24 Mar 1900) they (Jennie, Charles and 2 sons) lived with his former mother-in-law, Anna Lane. Charles and Jennie  had a son and two daughters in Indiana.  The youngest of these born Jan 29, 1909. The 1910 ( 10 April 1910) census (very difficult to find as last name wrong) shows them in Jordan Valley, OR. where he is pastor of the ME Church.  The oldest boys now in their 20's did not come west. Twins, Leon and Leona were born there, and last child, my father, Russell Sage Faris born 24 Nov, 1912 in the parsonage. During the years in Jordan Valley my grandfather was a circuit rider preacher riding horseback to the mining towns of Silver City, Dewey and Delamar, all in Owyhee Co. Idaho, along with pastoring Jordan Valley. 
     In 1918 he moved to a farm at  Murphy, Owyhee Co. Idaho.  The 2 January, 1920 census shows him, his  wife and 6 children on Guffey Street, and lists him as a farm manager.  Owyhee Co is where he had been a circuit rider. He was there 2 years and in 1920 moved to Glenns Ferry, Elmore, ID. He first farmed a little east of town along the Snake River.  Then he purchased a house in  town. He stayed there 10 years.  The twins and my father graduated from Glenns Ferry High School. 1930 census (3 April 1930)  says he owns his home and is proprietor of an auto shop. (This occupation never mentioned by my father) His obituary says he was involved in farming and later the railroad in Glenns Ferry, a RR town.  There were 2 boarders listed in Glenns Ferry 1930 census. One daughter married a railroader and one son started as a "caller" on the railroad and was employed his working career by UPPR.
     Obit says they moved to Caldwell, Canyon, ID in 1930 and shortly thereafter purchased a boarding house at 708 Dearborn Street.  This is the home I remember. The 1940 census (10 April, 1940)  shows 10 boarders, no children living at home with Charles retired and Grandma proprietress.   The house had small apartments, and single rooms for boarders.  I remember the dining room was large and my grandmother cooked for the boarders. I have no recollection of Charles.  He died of a brief illness May 15, 1940. Grandmother continued living at the house with boarders until health issues motivated her to move in with a daughter. She died 17 Dec 1979 age 102.  I have family pictures of her 80 and 100th birthday.
     The boarding house was sold and moved to Guffey.  My dad and brother went there to see it once, and said it looked sad.  I did not realize until looking at the census that Guffey was a street, not a town; they always referred to living at Guffey.
     Most of the information is posted on ancestry, my tree is PINETREE.  It appears my grandfather was a "jack of all trades" and that must be where my father acquired many skills, along with being a CB in the Navy, in WWII.  My family said my dad could fix anything, and that was true.
