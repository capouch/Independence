SYLVESTER P. HART

Sylvester P. Hart was born in 1835 in Winsor county, Vermont. We
find Sylvester P. Hart and his wife Frances or Fanny Brown Hart in the
early (1860-1890) record of the Medaryville Methodist Church and its
Circuits. However, there seems to be no definite record that he was a
minister of the church. We find the couple listed in various early
classes at Independence; and in one listing, he was reported as deceased.
In the membership list we find Frances (Fanny) listed as Fanny Hart, wife,
then widow of Sylvester P. Hart; then as wife of William F. Anderson.

Most of the information we have about Sylvester Hart came from Archive
records pertaining to his service in the Union Army during the Civil war,
and pensions for his minor children after his death.

He enlisted at LaPorte, Ind., on the 28th. of Jan., 1865 for a
period of one year, giving his age as 22 years. He was described as a
farmer, with hazel eyes, brown hair, fair complexion, 5'10 1/2" high, a
private in Co. A, 151 Regt., Indiana Infantry; and was mustered out with
the company on Sep. 19, 1865 at Nashville, Tenn., disabled by disease of
the stomach and bowels.

He died in 1872. He had been united in marriage Dec. 23, 1858 to Miss
Frances Angeline Brown,  in Morgan county, Indiana.

Application was filed Feb. 5, 1890 for a Guardian for minor children
stating that Sylvester had died in Gillam township on Oct.2, 1872 and that 
the mother of the children had re-married William Anderson. The children
were listed as Flora E., b. 11-18-1859; Frank M., b 11-9-1863; Ida M.,
b. 1-5-1872.  In an affidavid appeared Asa C. Prevo and James Antrim
of Rensselaer, testifying to the truth of the facts as stated.

It has been said that both Sylvester Hart and William Anderson were
pastors of the Independence Church.  These people are all buried 
there in Independence Cemetery, William Anderson beside his first wife,
Catherine Preston Anderson.  Sylvester Hart, Frances Brown Hart and
children aged one, two, and four years of age; Flora Hart and her 
husband Preston M. Querry; and Ida Hart Minshall, all in the South 
Section.
