He was a tall man, of imposing appearance. During the War of the Rebellion, his sons Michael, William and Thomas were in the Battle of Gettysburg, at which time William was shot in the face by a sniper. He, on hearing the news, donned his tall hat and long coat and took a train to the hospital where his son lay wounded. On being told it would be out of the question to move the son to a hospital where he could be better cared for, he went into action, and had him on a train that eveing. It is said he twirled his Masonic charm which he wore on his watch chain, which must have helped. On another occasion, word came that his son Thomas was in an army prison, after being involved with a buddy in an altercation with an officer, and Thomas came to his aid. The father immediately entrained for Washington, D.C. where he went directly to his Congressman, Schuyler C. Colfax. Mr. Colfax took him to see the President, Abraham  Lincoln. Mr. Lincoln asked: "What do you wish from me, Mr. Robinson?" The reply: "Mr. President, I have three sons in the Union Army. I sent them to fight, not to rot in prison." It is related that Pres. Lincoln reached for a pen and wrote out an order, directing the military to restore Thomas to active duty with his regiment. It is evident that Mr. William Harrison Robinson was a man of strong character!

He served all through the Civil War, being promoted from Private to Lieutenant. In his pension papers we find a story of a terrible experience that illustrates the suffering the soldiers endured from sickness and hardships. On New Year 1864 he was in charge of a group of men en route to their homes on furlough. They were thoroughly soaked in rain, then placed in a cattle car of a train, with no protection. The temperature dropped to a very low degree so their clothing froze to their bodies, their boots to their feet. On the slow journey north, it was January 8th. before he arrived at his home, and by this time he was very ill, and was unable to return to duty for some time. He suffered after effects the rest of his live. (History of C.L.Guild Post, G.A.R., Medaryville, Ind.) [[Lt. Civil War]]
